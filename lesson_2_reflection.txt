What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, git lists the files that can be tracked. 
	I need to do it to add the files to the Git version control process. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area contains only files to be committed to the repository. So it 
	contains a set of files that may be different from working directory and the repository.
	This intermediate state offers more control over the process of commit. 
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	I can add only those files related to a logical change to the staging area and commit them.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	If I need to try some experimental features, then branching would be helpful.
	If multiple people works on the same project but try different approaches, 
	branching will help. 
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	The diagrams helps understand the reachability of the commits. 
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
