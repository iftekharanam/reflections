When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remorte repository would be useful for backing up codebase and sharing with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually allows us to work on different files at the same time. 
  Also automatic update might result in unstable codebase. 
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
  Fork allows to create a copy of an existing repository on Github. It is used to modify an existing 
  repository where we don't have permission to change. It also helps to keep track of the number of forks 
  on GitHub. 
  Clone creates a copy of an existing repository locally or on Github.
  A Branch creates a copy of the latest commit of a repository. A branch is created to share development 
  tasks in the same codebase. 
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It can be used to compare the changes in the remote since checkout of that copy. When we 
  make changes to the local copy and someone changes the remote copy, last known state of the 
  remote helps finding out all the changes.
