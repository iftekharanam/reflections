When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remorte repository would be useful for backing up codebase and sharing with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually allows us to work on different files at the same time. 
  Also automatic update might result in unstable codebase.
